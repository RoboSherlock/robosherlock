2019-06-26 - fix frame id in header of advertised result point cloud (#176) 

2019-06-25 - plane models can be stored as part of the semantic map entry (#174) 
* check if plane equation is defined as part of the semantic map and set as plane annotation

* basic query answering through a fixed action interface
* example action client

2019-06-19 - Multi camera support in a single pipeline (#172 and #173i) 
* introduce id system for multiple identical cameras in a single pipeline
* set active camera ids in bridges
* set query with setFS to avoid adding cam ID to it
* unifying melodic and kinetic builds
* melodic uses system opencv..no more contrib
* in Storage prepend cam0 to viewname if no cam id present
* other minor bug fixes

2019-03-25 - ros fixes (#167) 
* async spinner in RSProcessManager; removed spin from cam interface; new proxy class for tf::TransformListener
* when filtering for individuals or annotations look at direct subclasses as well.
* add view name for display image

2019-03-22 - add missing getQuery to QueryInterface (#165) 
* add method to get query document from QueryInterface

2019-03-12 - Merged AggregateAE and RSAE implementation (#164) 
* split functionality of RSAnalysisEngine between RSAggregateAnalysisEngine and RSProcessManager
* new CollectionReader class for creating a CPE
* moved semantic map reading to Region filter
* add executable to run an AAE; loads an AE yaml and runs fixed flow continuously;

2019-03-04 - capability assertion from AAE defintition  (#162) 
* allow overwriting of capabilities in the aggregate AE config file; useful for classifiers where output domain and input restricion changes with the parameters

2019-03-04 - Point cloud filtering depending on a given transform frame (#160) 
* Add frame selection to PointCloudFilter with frame parameters for target (source frame is always cloud frame)

2019-02-26 - Embedded SWI-Prolog knowledge engine (#161) 
* documented methods of RSProcessManager and cleand up
* fix Cluster3DGeometry (initialize mins and maxs properly)
* new abstract class fro KnowledgeEngine; Modified query answering class to use new interface; moved parsing of json string out of json interface
* fix Cluster3DGeometryAnnotator's meta definition
* throw exceptions when something goes wrong with PL_engines
* pick knowledge engine at startup; 
* some fixes and more queries in SWIPLInterface
* moved knowrob related files into project. RoboSherlock can now be loaded into json prolog; robosherlock_knowrob package becoming deprecated.
* tests for query interfae and swipl interface

2019-01-24 - json conversion of RS types; (#156) 
* Made query answering extendible: 
- implemented rs::conversions::to for rapidjson::Document
- object descriptions are generated from type using this conversion
- query answering works using these new descriptions
- query keys are asserted to knowledge base at run time; 
- namespaces are looked up the first time we assert something; 
- added parameter flag for enabling query answering
- so far only equals checks work (could be extended in future);
*Modifications to typesystem:
- rotations are now stored as quaternions
- SemanticColorAnnotation is for single colors; Store multiple SemColorAnnotations instead of a single one;

2018-12-14 - Devel cleanup (#155) 
- merged Yaml to XML converters into a single class
- cleanup in typesystem: removed unused types
- **breaking change**: rs::Cluster is now called rs::ObjectHypothesis; rs::MergedCluster is now called rs::MergedHypothesis

2018-12-04 - Parallel pipeline planning not dependent on json_prolog (#154) 
* build dependency graph of parallel pipeline execution based on information extracted from the YAMls; no need to query KnowRob anymore for the parallel planning
* removing Classifier from recognition; up to date version in rs_addons;

2018-10-25 - Devel realsense camer bridge (#151) 
* added bridge for RealSense camera
* PCL_DEFINITIONS is not needed

2018-09-23 - Stackification (#150) 
* uimacpp_ros, robosherlock_msgs, rapidjson_ros part of  a stack now;

2018-09-20 - VFH is the default for PCLDescriptorExtractor 

2018-09-20 - fix annototator generation script 

2018-09-18 - Devel fixes (#148) 
* annotator for saving results written on images; 
* Triggering can work now from a service of type std_srvs/Trigger
Fix:
* params that are arrays in yaml generate correct xml
* scripts for generating annotators and rs dependent packages

2018-09-11 - Yaml config for AE-s and domain restrictions for annotators when planning a pipeline (#147) 
* generate AE xmls from YAML config files
* assert metadata to KB from yaml parsing directly
* ROS_INFO instead of std::cerr and std::cout for output
* fixed annoying mongoDB bug (if can't convert mongo entry to RS type, don't crash but catch error and handle)

2018-09-03 - new ROS interface and yaml migration (#144) 
* added ROS interface for setting a specific pipeline
* yaml files and script for generating them for annotators

2018-08-23 - Unit tests for annotators (#141) 
* unit tests for annotators
* implemented  reconfigure for some of the annotators
* fixed FeatureAnnotator

2018-08-21 - Refactoring: merged RSControledAE and RSAnalysisEngine (#142) 
* no more base64 image advertiser
* cleaned up query type; Moved ROS related parts out of ControledAE;
* more refactoring; result image publishing in RSProcessManager; Point clouds not there yet; Cleanup in designator wrapper; deleted deprecated members and deprecated type conversions; fix tests;

2018-08-17 - Refarctoring and fixes so YAML will work;  (#140) 
* modified the loopkup of domain specificitaions so YAML files can be also parsed
* moved yaml and XML stuff to flowcontrol
* completely removed RSPipelineManager; RSAAE incorporates its functionality

2018-08-14 - New changes made for YAML input - GSoC 2018 (#139) 
* annotators can have YAML definitions instead of XML; XML gets auto-generated;
* AEs do not need a list of delegates anymore; the fixed flow gets read during the init process and list of delegates is generated 

2018-08-10 - query answering development (#138) 
- assert annotators and their domains
- multiple checks in json per key
- deleted old PCLVFHFeatureExtractor
- small refactoring in RSControledAnalysisEngine (use init from parent class)
